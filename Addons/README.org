*** Elisp
=rdf.el=

A small hack for Emacs users, who also utilize =AucTeX= and =reftex=
It converts the classical equation environment such as:
#+begin_src 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:test:1}
  \int f dx =0
\end{equation}
#+end_src

To 
#+begin_src 
\begin{equation}[eq:test:1]
  %\label{eq:test:1}
  \int f dx =0
\end{equation}
#+end_src



*** Latex style file
=rdfref-equation.sty=

This allow to use
#+begin_src 
\begin{equation}[eq:test:1]
  %\label{eq:test:1}
  \int f dx =0
\end{equation}
#+end_src

** The logic of references:  sources and targets

In Latex files you can refer to equations (using the =\ref= =\eqref=, =\autoref= or any other =LaTeX= reference command)
like 

#+begin_src 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:test:1}
  \int f dx =0
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:test:2}
   f =0
\end{equation}
which is a consequence of \autoref{eq:test:1}
#+end_src
   
This simple example is displayed, (when compiling with =pdflatex= or =xelatex=, or =luatex= in any modern) pdf viewer and it is possible to jump to the target and back to the source.
The target is defined by the =label=, the source by the =ref=.

However for =rdfref= that generates dependency graph, using arrows, this is a bit of a problem.
The example above translated into =rdfref= syntax looks like.
#+begin_src
\begin{equation}[eq:test:1]
  %\label{eq:test:1}
  \int f dx =0
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}[eq:test:2]
  %\label{eq:test:2}
   f =0
\end{equation}
which is a consequence of \autoref{eq:test:1}
#+end_src

But will result in the following graph.

So the correct syntax would require to place the reference directly blow the equation you consider as a source
 
#+begin_src
\begin{equation}[eq:test:1]
  %\label{eq:test:1}
  \int f dx =0
\end{equation}
which implies \autoref{eq:test:2}
\begin{equation}[eq:test:2]
  %\label{eq:test:2}
   f =0
\end{equation}
#+end_src
